        <h1>Until next time!</h1>
        <p>My online profile is concluding and what a perfect time to provide you with my goals and career aspirations.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'll graduate from this ACS progam in the Spring of 2024. Until then, I hope to stay in my current roll with O'Reilly because it's the perfect workload to support my journey through school right now. O'Reilly is generous enough to provide tuitiion to Team Members who aspire to go back to school and get a tech-related degree or certificate. That's why I'm here. It was an opportunity I couldn't pass up and one that I hope will make me a more well-rounded contributor to my team mates.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Below are a few of my short-term goals while I'm in school.</p>

          <h2>Get Cozy with Java</h2>
          <p>I'm exposed to Java code all day every day. Until this Fall semester, I didn't understand a word of it. My Java Programming 1 course was difficult, but allowed me to put some pieces together at work and I'm now able to understand at a high level what the development team is doing and the problems they face.</p>
          <p>My goal is to walk through the project's repo, feature by feature, and try to inderstand the technical piece of the solutions I designed the functional piece for. Ultimately, I'd like to start condidering development during the design process in order ot make more informed decisions and thorough solutions for the problems we face. </p>

          <h2>Build my business website</h2>
          <p>As my rental property businesss continues to grow, I'm needing a central location to allow myself and my tenants to stay on the same page and communicate with eachother.</p>
          <p>I intend for my business website, Ozark Premier Properties, to have features like a payment portal and a maintenance request form. I haven't decided if I want to open it up to list available properties, but if I do I'd need a way for potential renters to contact me. My goal is to have this website complete by the end of the Spring 2024 semester, once I have WebDev II under my belt.</p>

          <h2>Build a logistics app for O'Reilly</h2>
          <p>O'Reilly hosts a massive leadership conference every year for Store managers all around the states to attend. There are ~8-10 thousand TMs who attend, so imagine the planning it takes to pull this event off.</p>
          <p>Those in charge of planning to an excellent job every year, however they're the ones who have beebn planning it for decades. All the knowledge is in their head or stored on their local hard drive in Excel cheets. I'd like to design and build an app and/or website to plan this event from end to end. While there's nothing wrong with how this event is planned today, in fact it goes off without a hitch most years, there has to be a better way to plan and control logistics from a tablet or smartphone. That's the problem I intend to solve by using my knowledge gained through this program.</p>
