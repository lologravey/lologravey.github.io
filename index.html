        <h1>Greetings!</h1>
        <p>I (Lauren Graves) am excited you found me and eager to share a bit of my life with you. </p>
        <p>I work for O'Reilly Auto Parts as a Busines Systems Analyst and am approaching year 5 with the company. I own a few rental properties on the side and am constantly looking to improve them. I don't strive to have so many that it becomes unenjoyable. I just like restoring them to their prime state and ensure confortable living for my tenants.</p>
        <p>I'm currently in school working towards my ACS. This online profile "shows off" what I've learned this FA22 semester in Web Dev, from the skills standpoint. It also tells you a bit more about my background and education and my professional aspirations.</p>

          <h2>I have a cat, Moses</h2>
          <p>He came into my life at the perfect time, as most pets do. I assumed "he" was a "she", but his first vet visit cleared things up. I'm still adapting to Moses, as his previous name was Mona. But that's okay. Still the same cat.</p>

          <h2>I love when Spotify recaps</h2>
          <p>There's nothing better to watch yourself evolve through music throughout the course of a year. What I listened to in January is vastly different than what I'm listening to in December the same year. <i>Cheers to evolving!</i> </p>

          <h2>I like my family, a lot</h2>
          <p>If I could have fit a picture of my whole family in this little div I would have. So settling for a pic with my two favorite people; Brooke and Ben; sister and partner trying to dance at my brother's wedding.</p>
