        <h1>Employment Background & Education</h1>
        <p>i work with a team of developers to design, build, and implement new and improved solutions that help our retail store Team Members. In simple terms I, along with my fellow peers, help make it easier for TMs to sell auto parts and perform daily business tasks.</p>
        <p>O'Reilly has a lot of systems that the various IT teams build and support. The three main platforms include our retail customer website, professional customer website, and the retail store's POS (point of sale) software. I help design the POS.</p>
        <p>Below you can read about my day-to-day job functions as a systems analyst. </p>

          <h2>Gather System Requirements</h2>
          <p>In order to know how the system is desired to work, I meet with our retail stakeholders to gather system requirements. I collect and document everything from color schemes to keyboard navigation rules.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This step is essential because the document written and is the official deliverable the development team uses to build the product.</p>

          <h2>Design the UI and User Flows</h2>
          <p>Once I've gathered and documented the requirments provided, it's time to build and design the screen UI and user flows. Mockups are supplemental visuals to help the developers (and anyone else reading the document) to visualize what the intention of the requirements are.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This is the most time-consuming step of the project because, truthfully, it's when all the questions arise and requirements questioned. It's the part of the process where, on the design level, we work through the "gotchas" before handing the document to the dev team.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="item-quality">
          <h2>Support the Development Team</h2>
          <p>Once the requirments and solutions have been approved by the retail stakeholders, the devs take the document and break the work down into bite-size chunks of work that can be developed in 2 week sprints. I work on the strategic team, meaning our projects last 1-2 years beginning to end.</p> 
          <br>
          <p>This is an exciting time for the the Team. It's an "all hands on deck" experience and is when we come together to build a great product. As code is written and deployed to test, I then test what has been built and make sure it's working per the requirements.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="item-quality">
          <h2>Assist with Software Deployments</h2>
          <p>When the program has been built and undergone numerous rounds of testing by me, QA, and our stakeholders, it's ready to stage for deployment. O'Reilly has ~6,000 stores. For large projects like these, we roll out slooooowwwww just in case there's an unknown blocker hiding in the code.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Rollout, or "Pilot", is also an exciting time. Assisting with Pilot means some of us go to the stores and conduct another round of testing to ensure everything is working expected. It's pretty awesome to see our store TMs' reactions to the newness. </p>
