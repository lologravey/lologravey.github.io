        <h1>Employment Background & Education</h1>
        <p>I have a pretty classic background. I grew up in Eldon, MO and graduated high school in 2012. After graduation I attended the local community college to get the "cheap" general education requirements out of the way before moving to Springfield in 2014 to attend Missouri State University.</p>
        <p>After dipping my toes in a few different programs ranging from Education to Dietetics, I finally settled somewhere in the middle. I graduated from MSU in 2017 with a BA in Professional Writing. This degree program offered practical business knowledge and writing skills in order for any graduate to land a job in whatever business they desire.</p>

          <h2>Central Bank of the Ozarks</h2>
          <p>2014 - 2017</p>
          <br>
          <p>Through college I worked at a local Springfield bank. I absolutely loved the work, process, and people. I believe this is where I learned "process" and how effective it can be when followed. I mean, you have to follow process at a bank in order to keep your job and perform. However, it gave me a lot of organizational skills I still have today.</p>

          <h2>Trinity Health Care, Prime Inc.</h2>
          <p>2016 - 2017</p>
          <br>
          <p>The Professional Writing degree program requires its students to find an internship at a local business and fulfil a documentation need they may have.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I chose Trinity Healthcare, which is the internal health practice within Prime, Inc. I was tasked with documenting their new EMS (electronic medical system) and to create user, system, and how-to guids for the health care employees used the system every day.</p>

          <h2>Digital Monitoring Products (DMP)</h2>
          <p>2017 - 2018</p>
          <br>
          <p>I started at DMP as a technical writer immediately after graduation. (for anyone still in school and about to land a full-time gig, do yourself a favor and take the break! You deserve it.)</p> 
          <br>
          <p>DMP manufactures security panels and products. My responsibilities incuded writing all the hardware documentation for thos products. The documentation list is a mile long, but a few of those docs included Installation Guides, User Guides, Complience Guides, and How-To Guides. </p>

          <h2>O'Reilly Auto Parts</h2>
          <p>2018 - Present</p>
          <br>
          <p>I was looking for more of a challenge in my career. I had friends who raved about O'Reilly culture and how fun the systems were to work on. I had no idea at the time that I'd learn to appreciate software and what goes into building it.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I made a lateral move from DMP and started as a technical writer. In a few short years with just as many projects under my belt, I was offered the analyst position and still in that role today.</p>
